	<p align="justify"> When I was 12 years old, I used to be a librarian for a year at Sekolah Kebangsaan Tapang. During the one year I served as a librarian, I learned how to serve other students so that they understood the rules in the library. When I was in high school, I was appointed as a librarian for 4 years starting from 2014 to 2018. At this time I began to realize that the responsibility of a librarian is very big not just looking after other students in the library. I began to get to know and perform many tasks such as stamping books, stacking books and so on. </p>

	<p align="justify"> For the job experience, I used to work as a salesgirl in KB Mall. In my previous job, I got a lot experience like how to handle customer's temperament. I worked as a salesgirl for only a few months because after that, I got an offer to further my studies at UiTM. At the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic that hit the world, I had time to trade while studying. Among the products I sold at that time were Nurayssa beauty products, Nims ChocoTub, Jeruk Liur Leleh, and my own product, PopJar which is 'popia' with melted chocolate. </p>
